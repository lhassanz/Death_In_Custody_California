# Death_In_Custody_California
I am one of three in a group for the purpose of a Capstone project for my final course in my Big Data Analytics Master's program at San Diego State University.
This will also feature my Report and code, my there will be a link provided for the Dashboard and Website we made for this project.  The Dashboard is made from ArcGIS and the Website from Google Sites.
Main contribution was Pre-processing the code, assistance with machine learning models, and developing the visualizations of the data from python script. You can read more in my report, or check out the code provided in this repository.
